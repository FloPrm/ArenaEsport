Recruitment is the first step in a long series of problems: to encourage the meeting of the right people from the start is to establish a solid foundation to face all the obstacles to come. It is a laborious phase that must be exceeded to access all that the gaming may have to offer."
    mission2: "In a more general way, we hope that the existence of Arena - an unprecedented initiative on the road to the professionalization of gaming - will push some entrepreneurial people tomorrow to create companies responding to the needs of players."
